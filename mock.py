                  'post_caption': "ü§ñ OpenAI is on a mission to reach human-level intelligence with its AI systems, and it's closer than you might think! The company has outlined a five-level system to track its progress toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Currently, OpenAI is at the first level, which focuses on conversational AI, but it's already making strides toward level two. üåê\n\nüß† The second level, known as 'Reasoners,' involves AI that can perform basic problem-solving tasks, akin to a human with a doctorate but without access to tools. Imagine an AI that can think critically and solve complex problems! The third level, 'Agents,' will see AI performing various actions for several days on behalf of its user. üöÄ\n\nüí° The fourth level, 'Innovators,' is where things get really exciting. At this stage, AI will be capable of developing new inventions, pushing the boundaries of innovation. OpenAI's research with GPT-4 has already shown human-like reasoning skills, indicating that we're on the right path. Stay tuned as we follow this incredible journey! ",
